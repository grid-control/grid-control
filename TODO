FEATURE REQUESTS:
===================================================
1. Castor support
2. Parameters ?

DONE:
===================================================
X. Local batch system support
	(PBS, LSF, SGE, SLURM)
X. Multiple datasets
X. Please check bugfix for SUBMITTED status in glite.py, rev. r763
	(seems ok)
X. Show location in job-status/ ev. have information output
	(fixed?)
X. override runtime files
X. MaxCPUTime in config files to be give in hours, but not properly translated to jdl requirement in MINUTES!
   Please make hours and minutes usage in MaxWallTime and MaxCPUTime consistently in hours.
X. FIX continous mode (-ic) (welches Problem)
	(fixed?)
X. enable conditions for job failure (e.g. root-file <1 MB...)
	([storage]: se min size)
X. add timestamp to storage-out-files
	([storage]: se output pattern)
X. decuple CMSSW-version and grid-requirements. - Die nasen vergessen immer die TAGS...
	([CMSSW]: use requirements)
X. Possibility to use job states in abbreviated form for the -d deletion command.
   E.g. use first letter up to point where unique in list of all job states. (-d W,RE,Q)
	(-d R == READY,RUNNING; -d RE == READY; -d R,Q == READY,RUNNING,QUEUED; ...)
X. Or: Shorthand for -d deletion of all jobs in WAITING READY or QUEUED state.
	(-d TODO, -d ALL)
X. Update job status on dashboard
	(done)
X. Random seed as command line argument
	(-S 1234,423,7856)
X. Local job finish signal (move files from se)
	([events]: on status, on submit, on output)
X. FIX whitelisting
	(fixed?)
X. Option to "dont retry" - retry count
	(-m 4: Retry up to 3 times)
X. Possibility to give time limit after which jobs in WAITING, READY or QUEUED state
   are automatically cancelled (and then resubmitted in case of -c option).
	([jobs]: queue timeout = x; hours)
X. Statistic of done, failed, cancelled not only in total but optionally also per ce
   including failed and resubmitted jobs (good for blacklisting ...)   
	(-R, -RR for site report)
X. Transfer CMSSW runtime via SE
	([CMSSW]: se runtime = true)
X. Local disk usage monitoring
	(break on low disk space)
X. Use md5 hash to verify transfer between node <-> se
	(see verify.py)
X. do "scram b python" to update search paths
	(fixed by inplace replace in __init__.py files)
